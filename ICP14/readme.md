In this ICP I got to know about Notification, Calendar,and Publishing apps to Google Play Store.

# OUTPUTS

This is the simple calendar view where we can choose a date to know the events

Here we do create events manually for the date we wish and save them

This shows us the overview of our event with timings, location and etc

This generally shows the events of the coming days where the event we included can aso be viewed among those existing events
